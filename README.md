# Terraform IaC Assignment

## Overview
This project provisions an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket using Terraform. It also updates the infrastructure by adding a security group.

## Deployment steps
I installed Terraform and configured it to work with AWS. (The aws cli had been previously installed) Next, I obtained the codes from the terraform registry.

I initialized Terraform using the 'terraform init' command 
Then I used the 'terraform plan' command to get an overview of the infrastructures to be provisioned

'terraform apply' to create the infrastructures

'terraform destroy' to destroy the provisioned resources.

## screenshots and codes are uploaded in this repo
